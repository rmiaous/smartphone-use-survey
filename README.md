# smartphone-use-survey

We developed a 15 survey questions website, which studies and analyzes the
smartphone use of college students. 

The project is to collect data from American college student in order to research the status of smartphone use and impact on their education. Furthermore, we plan to write an analysis reports. 

Therefore, we think that the report could help college students to control the excess use of smartphones and boost the academic performance of students.
