The project is to collect data from college student to research the status of smartphone use and its impact on their education.

Moreover, we developed a 15 survey questions website, which studies and analyzes the smartphone use of college students. 

Furthermore, it could help college students know about the excessive use of smartphones and boost the academic performance of students.
